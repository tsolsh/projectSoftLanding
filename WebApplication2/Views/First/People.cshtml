            <h1 id="name">Alan Turing</h1>
            <h2 id="sentence">
                Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS was a British pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner.
                He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
                Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
                Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre.
